- Component-driven UI
- Uses JavaScript and CSS for styling and logic
- Demonstrates frontend routing (if applicable)
- Designed for modularity and scalability

---

- **Create React App** – Bootstrapped React application tooling  
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**  
- **CSS**  
- Additional packages listed in `package.json`
